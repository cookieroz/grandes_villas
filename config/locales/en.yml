      aboutintro: |
        is a company exclusively focused on holiday rentals, mostly offering Villas.
        Thanks to the magnitude of these enclaves, we can assure certain facilities that
        others simply cannot provide.

        Nevertheless, our business objectives are focused on making Grandes Villas a way
        to travel, an experience for the guest, rather than offering accommodation. Since
        we started up in 2010, our range of products and services have been increasing,
        with the only purpose of satisfying your needs and making you experience the
        feeling of traveling with Grandes Villas.
